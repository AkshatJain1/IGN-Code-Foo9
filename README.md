# IGN-Code-Foo9
Repository for the mini-projects defined by IGN's Code Foo 9 Internship Application.

https://www.ign.com/code-foo/2019

As a 17 year old, I wasn't eligible for the internship but I completed some of the projects just for fun anyways.

Please switch branches to see my backend, frontend and Witcher projects.
